# Decentralized Credit Scoring System

## Introduction
This project is a decentralized credit scoring system built using Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and Solidity for the smart contracts. The project integrates external APIs to gather financial and non-financial data to calculate credit scores stored on the blockchain for transparency and security.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Web3, Truffle
- **Database**: SQLite (for initial prototyping)

## Features
- User registration and login
- Credit score calculation
- Integration with external APIs
- Decentralized data storage on the blockchain

## Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
